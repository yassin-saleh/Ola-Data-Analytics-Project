# 🚗 OLA Data Analyst Project  
**Project Category:** Advanced Data Analytics  

---

## 🧠 Overview  
The **OLA Data Analyst Project** is a complete end-to-end data analysis initiative that focuses on understanding and optimizing ride-booking activities for **OLA** in **Bengaluru, India**.  

The project replicates a real-world analytics scenario by analyzing data for **100,000 bookings** collected over one month.  
It aims to provide key insights into:
- Ride booking trends  
- Revenue distribution  
- Cancellation behavior  
- Customer satisfaction and rating performance  
- Operational efficiency of vehicle types  

All analysis and dashboards were developed using **Power BI**, **SQL**, and **Excel**.
